# Sewage Overflow Prediciton

The Idea is to build a neural network model to predict future sewage overflows in the crowded cities of India. We expect to see a pattern in the sewage overflows. Ex: x out of y of the manholes in New Delhi overflow during rainy season. So with IOT we can collect real time data of the following:

* The depth of the manhole at any given point
* The rate(speed) of the water flowing.
* Precipitation at a given time.\
* And many more

We feed this data to our deep learning model as input and would like to classify whether a given sewage will overflow or not.
